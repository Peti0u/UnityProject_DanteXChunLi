# UnityProject_DanteXChunLi
As part of my first-year Unity class project, I develop a small **platformer video game** during three days

To give some context regarding the "game’s creative direction", as I'm not particularly fan of classic platformers, I decided to imagine a concept closer to *Street Fighter* but with obstacles and progressive steps

I selected three well-known characters from that universe : *Dante*, *Chun Li*, and *Ryu*. Playing as *Dante*, you enter a combat zone with the first objective of **reaching** and **defeating** *Chun Li* before facing *Ryu*. Along the way, various minor but dangerous enemies block your path. The environment is filled with traps but also reassuring with apples that restore health and bushes that hide you.  
**Will you emerge victorious from these battles ?**


### Useful Informations

**Controls (*Dante*):**
- Move : Arrow keys (Left / Right)
- Jump : Space
- Gun Shot : A
- Dodge: Z
- Sword Attack : E

**Environment :**
- Bushes : can hide you, enemies can no longer see you once inside but the bush disappears after use
- Apples : restore 1 HP
- Traps : cause 1 damage
- Chest : leads to the second level
- Basic Enemies : 1 HP, single attack causing 1 damage
- *Chun Li* : 5 HP, single attack causing 2 damage
- *Ryu* : 10 HP, two attacks (ranged : 2 damage, melee : 1 damage)
